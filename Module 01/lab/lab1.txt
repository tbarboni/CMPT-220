2 Executing Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------

2.2.1. Which steps perform input?
        4
2.2.2. Which steps perform output?
        9,10
2.2.3. Which steps modify the value of a variable?
        5,6,7,10
2.2.4. Which steps involve a mathematical operation?
        10
2.2.5. Which steps perform iteration? 
        7,9
2.2.6. This algorithm contains a "bug": a logical error that results in
incorrect output.  Where is the problem?  How can it be fixed?
        Step 7 does not allow the triangle to reach the height labled in the height variable.
        To fix this you must change step 7 to repeat while the row variable is less than or equal to height.

3 Creating Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------

3.1.1. Algorithm
    1) Draw a straight horizontal line 2 inches long. 
    2) Starting from where the last line ended draw a vertical line 2 inches down
    3) Starting from where the last line ended draw a horizontal line 2 inches left
	(This line should end 2 inches below where you originally started)
    4) Connect the end of the last line drawn with the starting point of the first one.
	(Each line should be of equal length.)
3.1.5. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
    I didn't specify which direction to draw the first horizontal line. I also gave no tools/guidance on how to draw an accurate 2" line.
3.2.1. Algorithm
    1) Create a variable with the name "base"
    2) Create a variable with the name "height"
    3) Ask your partner for the values of each variable
    4) starting at the first row mark the left most box with an x
    5) Continue marking the box to the right of the last box marked until the amount of boxes marked is equal to the base.
    6) Now starting back at the left most box of the first row, begin marking the boxes below until the total amount of marked boxes in column 1 is equal to the value of height
    7) Now starting from the lowest marked box, move you pencil to one box up and to the right
	    mark box with an x and repeat until you reach row one

3.2.5. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
    The resulting triangle is either not an accurate/complete right triangle, or it has a base 1 unit longer than specified.
3.3.1. Algorithm
    1) Create three variables titled width, and height
    2) Ask your partner for the values of width and height 
    3) Create a third value titled perim
    4) Complete the operation (length + width) * 2 and assign the result to perim
3.3.5. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
        Algorithm worked as intended
3.4.1. Algorithm
    1) Create a variable named "l" 
    2) Create a variable named "r"
    3) Create a variable named A, AS, AT, and AC
    3) Ask your partner for the values of the variables for l and r (They should all be the same)
    4) Then complete the operation pi*r^2 and assign it to AC
    5) Complete the operation l^2 and assign it to AS
    6) Complete the operation ((sqrt(3))/4)l^2 and assign it to AT
    7) Find the sum of AS + AT + AC and assign it to the variable A
3.4.5. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm?
